Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run `main.py`, which uploads to google calendar, either ask me for the credentials file or create a new Google Cloud project, add OAuth with calendar scope for a desktop application, and download the credentials file (client secret). Add yourself as a test user, too.

You can also simply run `scrape.py`, which will print results to console.
